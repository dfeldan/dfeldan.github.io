About Me
---

I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [Analysis of Computer Systems Group](https://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/) at NYU's [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), where I am advised by [Professor Patrick Cousot](https://cs.nyu.edu/~pcousot/).

My research interests lie formal methods and static verification, with a focus on [abstract interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation). I am currently working on integrating abstract interpretations with symbolic execution in order to create a symbolic execution abstract domain that over-approximate, rather than under-approximates, program properties. 

Past Work
---
I previously worked on DARPA's [Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/securing-information-for-encrypted-verification-and-evaluation) project where we sought to optimize [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) of program executions by using abstract interpretations to [unroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling) programs before translating them into Boolean circuit. This culminated in my Master's Thesis, ["Program Unrolling by Abstract Interpretation for Probabilistic Proofs"](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/Daniel_Feldan_Masters_Thesis.pdf).

Before that, as part of my undergraduate studies, I analyzed [cascading failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure) in power grids, under the supervision of [Professor Sergey Buldyrev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qdDiaQoAAAAJ&hl=en). This work resulted in an undergraduate thesis, ["Maximizing the Study of Cascading Failures in Synthetic Electrical Grids"](https://repository.yu.edu/items/df1093bd-4f89-454e-b260-55b65721d17e).

Finally, I spent a summer studying how AI methods can be applied to solve partial differential equations with [Professor Steven Frankel](https://meeng.technion.ac.il/en/member/steven-frankel/).
