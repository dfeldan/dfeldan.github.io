About Me
=====

I am a fourth year Computer Science Ph.D. student and a member of the [Analysis of Computer Systems Group](https://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/) at NYU's [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), under the advisement of [Professor Patrick Cousot](https://cs.nyu.edu/~pcousot/).

My research interests include formal methods, static verification, [abstract interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation). Currently, I am attempting to synthesize abstract interpretations and symbolic execution to create a symbolic execution abstract domain that over-approximates a program's execution instead of under-approximating it. 

Past Work
---
I was previously part of DARPA's [Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/securing-information-for-encrypted-verification-and-evaluation) project in which we attempted to optimize the [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) of programs' executions by using abstract interpretations to [unroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling) the programs before their transformation into a boolean circuit. This resulted in a Master's Thesis, titled ["Program Unrolling by Abstract Interpretation for Probabilistic Proofs"](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/Daniel_Feldan_Masters_Thesis.pdf).

Before that, as part of my undergraduate degree, I worked to analyze [cascading failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure) in power grids, under [Professor Sergey Buldyrev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qdDiaQoAAAAJ&hl=en). This work resulted in an undergraduate thesis, titled [Maximizing the Study of Cascading Failures in Synthetic Electrical Grids](https://repository.yu.edu/items/df1093bd-4f89-454e-b260-55b65721d17e).

Lastly, I briefly worked for a summer studying how to use AI to solve partial differential equations with [Professor Steven Frankel](https://meeng.technion.ac.il/en/member/steven-frankel/).
